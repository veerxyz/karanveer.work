                <p>Take this model for example <br>
                I used Motion Capture through DeepMotion to create this Avatar <br>
                via readyplayer and infused it into web elements to make it dynamic, <br>
                rendering an illusion of interactivity that you can control ( via scroll ). <br>
                Hence the hand artefacts you see! <br>
                Usually, one sculpts a model in 3D software, <br>
                then rigs it, <br>
                animates it, <br> 
                the output is much better. <br>
                but this was also a fun learning experience!
